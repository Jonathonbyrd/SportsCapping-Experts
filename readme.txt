Yes and No. You may paste the calendar code into more then one location and end up with more then one calendar. But all of the calendars will read the same settings and all look the same.

Not only am I available through email or on my website, but I've also integrated a support forum into the configurations page so that you can ask questions directly from your wp-admin area.

A cold Guinness please.
